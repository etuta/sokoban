# sokoban

This is my version of the Sokoban game, a game that was originally created in 1981 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi. In this game, you need to push the boxes around
in a warehouse, trying to get them to their storage locations, marked with X's in my version. The player is confined to the board and may move horizontally or 
vertically onto empty squares. The player can move a box by sitting next to it and pushing it towards the square beyond, but cannot move boxes by pulling them. 
The number of boxes equals the number of storage locations and the puzzle is solved when all boxes are placed at storage locations. 

Getting started:

1. You will need Python3 and pygame.
